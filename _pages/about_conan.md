We welcomed Conan into our home in Apr 2025. He is a lovely F1 standard Sheepadoodle (mix between poodle and old English sheepdog) born locally at Alton, Iowa in 01/06/2025. He has a really really nice temper and never shows his teeth or barks first to either humans or fellow doggies. With that said, he needs lots of in-house training (well he is still a puppy!) and he has done a fantastic job learning how to sit, lay down, shaking paws, and even bow! He likes to play with Chuqi, but the cat in most scenarios outsmarts Conan ðŸ˜„ and teaches him how to show respect (by cat slap for sure).

His name originated from my favorite bookwriter, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. But given the popularity of the Japanese manga [Detective Conan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Closed) in China, I won't deny its influence on this name too. So we usually at home call with his Chinese pronounciation **Kenan** and hopefully it doesn't confuse this cutie puppy.
