"Nana" Chuqi is a 4-year-old Chinese calico cat. She was born in Changsha, and then traveled with my wife to Mexico and U.S. She subjectively is the most beautiful Chinese calico cat with a very nice front face. She is super smart knowing how to open the door, how to sneak out of the window, and how to identify that cats in videos are fake.

Her name came from a character in [Gujian2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570770/GuJian2/), a famous and enjoyable video game in China, who is an essential supporting co-star therein depicted with cunningness but loyalty. The name itself in Mandarin means the Seventh Day in the Lunar Calendar. According to that, she also has a arguably better-hearing Japanese name, **七ちゃん** (Nana-chan) or **七酱** in Chinese.
